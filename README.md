# CAIPs
Chain Agnostic Improvement Proposals (CAIPs) describe standards for blockchain projects that are not specific to a single chain.

# Contributing

 1. Review [CAIP-1](CAIPs/caip-1.md).
 2. Fork the repository.
 3. Add your CAIP to your fork of the repository. There is a [template CAIP here](caip-template.md).
 4. Submit a Pull Request to Chain Agnostics's [CAIPs repository](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs).

Your first PR should be a first draft of the final CAIP. An editor will manually review the first PR for a new CAIP and assign it a number before merging it. Make sure you include a `discussions-to` header with the URL to a discussion forum or open GitHub issue where people can discuss the CAIP as a whole.

If your CAIP requires images, the image files should be included in a subdirectory of the `assets` folder for that CAIP as follows: `assets/caip-N` (where **N** is to be replaced with the CAIP number). When linking to an image in the CAIP, use relative links such as `../assets/caip-1/image.png`.
