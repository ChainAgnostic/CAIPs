## Simple Summary

CAIP-319 defines a JSON-RPC method for a wallet to send notifications to a
caller in a context authorized by or in a valid [scopeObject][CAIP-217] and,
optionally, tagged with a [sessionId][CAIP-171] for maintaining session
continuity if applicable.

## Abstract

This proposal aims to define a standard method for wallets to send notifications
to callers regarding events or state changes related to a specific,
previously-authorized target network (such as nodes of a specific blockchain or
consensus community within a protocol). It requires a valid
[scopeObject][CAIP-217]. It MAY be tagged with a [sessionId][CAIP-171] if the
[CAIP-25][] session in which it is authorized is keyed by a sessionId (see
[CAIP-316][] for more details). These two properties MAY be inherited from a
persistent session created by [CAIP-25][], but could also be used as part of
other session management mechanisms.

## Motivation

The motivation for this proposal comes from the need for standardized,
chain-specific notifications from wallets to applications in a concurrent
multi-chain connection where methods and notifications with the same namespace may
exist across chains or namespaces.

## Specification

### Definition

The wallet is able to send a single JSON-RPC notification accompanied by a
[CAIP-2][] compatible `chainId`, and optionally scoped by the
[sessionId][CAIP-171] of a pre-existing session if applicable.

### Notification

The wallet or user agent would send a notification to the application as
follows:

```jsonc
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "wallet_notify",
  "params": {
    "sessionId": "0xdeadbeef",
    "scope": "eip155:1",
    "notification": {
      "method": "eth_subscription",
      "params": {
        "subscription": "0x12345678",
        "result": {
          "blockNumber": "0x1234",
          "transactionHash": "0x5678",
          "logIndex": "0x9abc"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The JSON-RPC method is labeled as `wallet_notify` and expects two required
parameters:

- **scope** - a valid [CAIP-2][] chainId previously authorized to the caller within a [CAIP-25][] session
- **notification** - an object containing the fields:
  - **method** - JSON-RPC notification method name previously authorized to the caller within a [CAIP-25][] session
  - **params** - JSON-RPC notification parameters

Additionally, it MAY include an **optional parameter**:

- **sessionId** - [CAIP-171][] `sessionId` referencing a known, open session

### Validation

1. The application MUST check the scope against the identified session object
   before processing the notification.
2. The application SHOULD verify that the notification.method is one it expects
   to receive for that specific scope.
3. The application MAY apply other logic or validation to the notification data.
4. The application MAY choose to ignore notifications it doesn't recognize or
   considers invalid.

### Response
As this syntax simply provides a wrapper to a standard [JSON-RPC notification][]
and functions as one itself, no response is expected from the application. The
wallet or user agent SHOULD NOT wait for a response before continuing its
operations.
